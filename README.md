# chess-es6.js
Note: This fork of chess-es6.js is specifically designed for [web-chess](https://github.com/jupiter24/web-chess).
You should probably use the original version.

chess-es6.js is a rewrite of ~jhlywa's [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/) in [es6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features), a newer version of Javascript.

It also includes the ability to parse PGN variations, as well as traverse the move tree and add new lines of play.

chess-es6.js can be transpiled down to es5 for peformant use in most web browsers.
